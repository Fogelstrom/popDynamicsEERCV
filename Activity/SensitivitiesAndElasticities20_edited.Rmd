## Sensitivity analysis  
  
In this exercise, we will study which vital rates/matrix elements have the strongest influence on population growth rate, $\lambda$.This can be accomplished in two ways; either by using manual perturbation methods, or by using analytical solutions. We will start with the manual perturbation method.

*Hudsonia montana* [image url](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Hudsonia_montana.jpg/1024px-Hudsonia_montana.jpg)

A dataset with transition matrices for *H. montana* called `hudsonia` is included in the `popbio` package. The matrices contain six classes: seed bank, seedlings and four size classes (tiny, small, medium, large).  

Start with loading the dataset, calculating a mean matrix and plotting the mean matrix:

```{r, eval =FALSE}
library(popbio)
data(hudsonia) #load dataset
hudsonia # the hudsonia dataset contains four matrices with vital rates
A <- mean(hudsonia) # calculate a mean matrix for the four years
A # print the mean matrix
image2(A) #plot the mean matrix
```


Study the mean matrix and try to understand the life cycle and what the different values mean. Use the mean matrix to project the mountain golden heather population. 


Your task is to perform a sensitivity analysis and to use your results to choose one of the following management regimes:  

1) Management that increases seed survival in the seed bank, or  
2) Management that increases seed production in the smallest size class (tiny)  

The general question for a sensitivity analysis is how a very small change in a particular matrix element (transition probability) affects the population growth rate $\lambda$. You'll find that some matrix elements have a large impact on $\lambda$, whereas other matrix elements do not influence $\lambda$ significantly.  

Calculate lambda for the matrix ...   
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Lambda is a matematical property of the matrix and we can 
# extract lambda by using the function 'lambda':
Lambda <- lambda(A)
```

... and create a copy of the matrix that we can modify
```{r eval = FALSE}
A_seedBank <- A # create a copy of the mean matrix 
```

Which matrix element corresponds to survival of seeds in the seed bank?

Add a small value, 0.0001, to the matrix element that is influenced by your management regime. That is, increase the probability of surviving in the seed bank with 0.0001. 
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
A_seedBank[1,1] <- A[1,1] + 0.0001 
```
  
Calculate $\lambda$ for the updated matrix A_seedBank, and store as e.g. `Lambda_seedBank`.  
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
Lambda_seedBank <- lambda(A_seedBank)
```

Now we can calculate the sensitivity for survival in the seed bank (matrix element a~11~) using the formula

$$S_{ij} = \frac {\lambda_{1, new}-\lambda_{1, original}} {a_{new}-a_{original}}= \frac{\delta\lambda_1} {\delta a_{ij}}$$

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sensitivitySeedBank = (Lambda_seedBank - Lambda)/0.0001
```
  
Now, let's calculate the sensitivity for seed production by tiny plants.
**Which matrix element represents seed production in the smallest size class (tiny)?**  

```{r , eval = FALSE}
 #copy the mean matrix:
A_seedProdTiny <- A

# increase the seed production of tiny plants
A_seedProdTiny[1,3] <- A[1,3] + 0.0001 

#Calculate lambda for the matrix with higher 
#   seed production for tiny plants
Lambda_seedProdTiny <- lambda(A_seedProdTiny)

# Estimate sensitivity for the seed production of tiny plants
# by dividing the difference in lambda with the difference
# in the matrix element 
sensitivitySeedProdTiny <- (Lambda_seedProdTiny - Lambda) + 0.0001
```
  
Compare the sensitivities for the different matrix elements

```{r eval = FALSE}
sensitivitySeedBank 
sensitivitySeedProdTiny
```

**So far, what is your conclusion regarding management regime?**  
  
  

## Elasticity values  

Let's have a look at the sensitivities for all the matrix elements:  
```{r eval = FALSE}
image2(sensitivity(A))
```

**Can you see any sensitivity values for impossible transitions?**

It can be difficult to compare the sensitivity of $\lambda$ to changes in fecundity (first row of the matrix) and survival rates (all but first row) because they are measured on different scales (fecundity can vary over several orders of magnitude whereas survival can only take values between 0 and 1). 

Sensitivity values are useful because they measure the absolute change in $\lambda$ in response to changes in vital rates. 
Elasticity values can be interpreted as proportional sensitivities. They measure the relative change in $\lambda$ in response to changes in vital rates. Elasticities are useful because they are comparable among vital rates (range between 0 and 1) and because impossible transitions get elasticities of zero.

The formula for calculating the elasticity for a matrix element is  

$$e_{ij}=\frac{\delta\lambda_1/\lambda}{\delta a_{ij}/a_{ij}}$$

Conveniently, there are functions in R that will allow us to calculate and plot the elasticities for all matrix elements at once. Let's use those functions and compare the elasticity values with our sensitivity values:  

```{r eval = FALSE}
image2(elasticity(A))
```

  

## Assignment, part 2  

a) Do you reach the same conclusion regarding management regime based on elasticity values as you did from the sensitivity values? Why?  

b) Can you suggest other alternative management scenarios that would have (much) larger effects on population growth rate?  

c) Which life stage / age class would be the best target for management in this case? Why?  


## Important points regarding the interpretation of results  

* We must remember that analytical sensitivities and elasticities are evaluated at the stable-stage distribution. Results might be very different in real-life situations if the population is far from SSD.  
  
* Analytical solutions say nothing about how much vital rates change in nature or under management! As an example, even if adult survival has the largest elasticity, it might not be possible to alter adult survival with management. In such cases, manual perturbation methods are good complements to analytical methods.  
  
* Sensitivities are based on small change at the current vital rate / matrix element. The real relation between a vital rate and $\lambda$ is often non-linear. A large perturbation of a vital rate can in such cases lead to large deviations between the analytical solution and the "FALSE" relationship.
